This project is a data visualization project that was completed using the JavaScript library d3.
In this project I initially took an FCC API that transferred United States Gross Domestic Product Data
and parsed it into JSON using XMLHttpRequest. I then used that same data and and iterated through it to extract the data I wanted and stored the array
into a variable. After that using the JavaScript library d3 extension I displayed the data on to a bar chart.
